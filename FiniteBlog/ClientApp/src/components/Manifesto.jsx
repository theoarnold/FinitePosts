          <p>Wypri is a response to modern social media's obsession with permanence.</p>
          <p>No accounts. No profiles to curate, no followers to chase every post stands on its own merit.</p>
          <p>Nothing permanent. Posts naturally fade. Share your thoughts, feelings, photography and music knowing it won't be there forever. The scarcity makes it more valuable.</p>
          <p>Annotations become the post. Instead of separate comment threads, responses weave directly into the original content. Your post becomes a canvas for everyone who views it.</p>    </div>
